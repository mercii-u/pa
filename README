    PA (Parser arguments for C)

    This is another argument parser, this was implemented since
    getopt by GNU did not return the name of the flag but the
    element in argv instead when an error occurred.

    This can be used as getopt is, the usage is pretty simple,
    just create a `pa_option` struct with the flags you
    need, for example

    struct pa_option flags[] =
    {
        {"filename", 'f', pa_takes_arg},
        {"help",     'h', pa_noway_arg},
        {"color",    'c', pa_might_arg},

        {NULL, 0, 0}
    };

    Where the first element is the name of the flag, the
    second the id of that flag and the third is to specify
    if the flag needs any argument.
    
    It accepts double slash (using the flag name) and single
    slash by using the id, for example

    $ ./a.out --filename somefile -c ../colors

    For single dashed flags the argument must be separated
    from the flag, for double dashed flags it can either be

    --filename filename
    --filename=filename

    You can take a look at 'source/demo.c' to get a better
    understanding
